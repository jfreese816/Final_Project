2,FLAME ON! 🔥 My good friends at @offtheline_performance having fun with their flamethrower RX7. New video today is live with link in bio! #thatdudeinblue #rx7 #fire #2step #mazda
3,Hey everyone! It’s that time of year again. If you’d like to have your car reviewed up in the north Georgia mountains I will be filming the July 14th-16th! I’m looking for cars that I have either never filmed before or are different enough to stick out. Email thatdudeinblue@gmail.com if you are able to show! #thatdudeinblue #carreview #cars #supra #mustang #s550 #mustanggt #turbo
4,Took a day off releasing videos for the holiday! Today I did some filming with @gingium and his incredible miata duo. Videos coming soon! I have a lot of editing ahead. #thatdudeinblue #miata #gingium #mazda
5,"In a subversive way it makes me happy to know that even @jeremyclarkson1 can run a rather large farm for 2 years, make very good, honest and interesting television about it, generally improve the global perceptions and respect due to farmers, make a simple comment about RAIN, and still get glib “stick to cars” comments."
6,Afternoon naps with Niki
7,"Don’t miss our interview with the knowledgable, wonderful @hannahelliottxo. She went to Pebble, dailies an old Rolls, and has driven some amazing things lately. We talk about the electrification of hypercars and motorcycles, Bentley’s new coach built GT, and more. Link in bio or grab it on your favorite podcast app."
8,"When I posted a shot of the Bronco’s open tailgate before asking if maybe it didn’t take up too much space, there was a bunch of “durrr but Jeep tho.” Comments. Making sure I wasn’t crazy, I found a Wrangler and measured. A Wrangler’s tailgate is 42 inches across. This is 50.5. If you don’t think eight inches of difference is a lot when measuring cars, it’s enough for most manufacturers to use nomenclature like “LWB.” In this photo, the Bronco is parked four feet from my garage door and the tailgate made impact when opened. I am digging the Bronco so far, but this is pretty poor design for usability, especially considering the pressurized hydraulics open it all the way (like a vertical tailgate). And all you “Durr Jeep” people can mind your P’s and fuckin Q’s because spidey sense was right: massively bigger than a Jeep."
9,I had a terrible time driving the new GR86 around @monticellomotorclub .
10,"You really need a lot of room to open this tailgate all the way, huh? That might be an issue with the 4-door. UPDATE: I measured. 50.5” tailgate compared to 42 on a wrangler. Massively bigger, so anyone who says it’s the same as a Jeep can suck it."
11,Nice little rig I got for this week!
12,The episode with @hannahelliottxo has been published!
13,What do you think of the new GR86 styling? Let us know and then go watch our review! Link in bio!
14,One rule of life is that you never pass an Alpine Coaster without stopping to have a go.
15,"In north Georgia putting 300 miles on the 2022 911 GTS Coupe 7MT w/ Lightweight package! Embargo 9/21 means I’m one of the first to have a go, even before Ze Germans. What a fuckin fabulous day to drive these mountains tho!"
16,"My review of the Toyota GR86 is up! This car had big shoes to fill. There's great risk when a car company updates a legend (ask BMW). The last 86/BRZ/FR-S was fun but flawed. A lot has been done to address its shortcomings. There's so much to cover you'll just have to watch the video.
